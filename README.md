The collatz conjecture
----------------------

The 3x+1 problem is a conjecture in mathematics which can be summarized as follows. Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One", or HOTPO[1]) indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.

This repo is an exercise in code optimization: I want to see how fast I can test this conjecture with many numbers.
